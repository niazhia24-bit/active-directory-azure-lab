The goal is to simulate a real-world enterprise setup by creating a domain controller, joining a client machine to the domain, and managing users through Active Directory.

Technologies Used:


Microsoft Azure, Windows Server 2022, Windows 10 / Windows 11, Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Virtual Network (VNet), Architecture Overview, DC-1: Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller), Client-1: Windows 10/11 (Domain-joined workstation), Virtual Network: Shared VNet for internal communication, DNS: Managed by Active Directory.
